          Breakfast is often called â€˜the most important meal of the day, and for
          good reason. As the name suggests, breakfast breaks the overnight
          fasting period. It replenishes the supply of glucose to boost energy
          levels and alertness, while also providing other essential nutrients
          required for good health.
